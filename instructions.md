# File Browser

## Getting Started

1. Copy/paste your ".onion" URL into any Tor-enabled browser. Options include:
   * Start9 Consulate (highly recommended)
   * Tor Browser
   * Firefox (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
   * Brave
2. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
3. Insert your default username and password. These can be found in the "Properties" section of your File Browser service.
4. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the "Properties" section mentioned above.

_If you update your username or password and forget either one of them, you will be permanently locked out of your File Browser server. **There is no password recovery!** We recommend either (1) not changing the defaults **OR** (2) using Bitwarden with proper backups._
